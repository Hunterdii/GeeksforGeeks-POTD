# 🚀 _2. Bitonic Point_ 🧠

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/searching-bonus-problems/problem/maximum-value-in-a-bitonic-array3001)

## 💡 **Problem Description**

Given an array of integers `arr[]` that is first strictly increasing and then maybe strictly decreasing, find the bitonic point, which is the maximum element in the array.

A **Bitonic Point** is a point before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing.

## 🔍 Example Walkthrough

**Input:**

```
arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 3]
```

**Output:**

```
8
```

**Explanation:**  
Elements before 8 are strictly increasing `[1, 2, 4, 5, 7]` and elements after 8 are strictly decreasing `[3]`.

**Input:**

```
arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

**Output:**

```
50
```

**Explanation:**  
Elements before 50 are strictly increasing `[10, 20, 30, 40]` and there are no elements after 50.

**Input:**

```
arr[] = [120, 100, 80, 20, 0]
```

**Output:**

```
120
```

**Explanation:**  
There are no elements before 120, and elements after 120 are strictly decreasing `[100, 80, 20, 0]`.

### Constraints:

- $3 \leq arr.size() \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^6$

## 🎯 **My Approach**

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**

   - The array is bitonic, meaning it has a single peak, with elements strictly increasing up to that point and strictly decreasing afterward.
   - The task is to find the bitonic point (the maximum value of the array).

2. **Binary Search Approach:**

   - Since the array has a strict increase followed by a strict decrease, we can use **binary search** to find the bitonic point in **O(log n)** time.
   - The idea is to find the middle element and compare it with its neighbors:
     - If the middle element is smaller than its next neighbor, the peak lies on the right side.
     - If the middle element is greater than its next neighbor, the peak lies on the left side or at the middle element itself.

3. **Steps:**
   - Initialize `lo = 0` and `hi = arr.size() - 1`.
   - While `lo < hi`:
     - Calculate `mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2`.
     - If `arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]`, move `lo = mid + 1` (since the peak is on the right).
     - If `arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]`, move `hi = mid` (since the peak is either at `mid` or to the left).
   - Finally, return `arr[lo]` which will be the maximum element.

## 🕒 **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity**

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(log n), where `n` is the size of the array. The algorithm uses binary search, which divides the search space in half at each step.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1), as the solution uses only a constant amount of additional space (no extra space is required for storing the result or during the search process).

## 📝 **Solution Code**

## Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int findMaximum(vector<int> &arr) {
        int lo = 0, hi = arr.size() - 1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1])
                lo = mid + 1;
            else
                hi = mid;
        }
        return arr[lo];
    }
};
```

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaximum(int[] arr) {
        int lo = 0, hi = arr.length - 1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1])
                lo = mid + 1;
            else
                hi = mid;
        }
        return arr[lo];
    }
}
```

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
	def findMaximum(self, arr):
		    lo, hi = 0, len(arr) - 1
		    while lo <= hi:
		        mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2
		        if mid == 0:
		            return max(arr[0], arr[1])
		        if mid == len(arr) - 1:
		            return max(arr[-1], arr[-2])
		        if arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1] and arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]:
		            return arr[mid]
		        elif arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1]:
		            lo = mid + 1
		        else:
		            hi = mid - 1
```
