## 13. Reverse Bits

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-bits3556/1)

### Problem Description

Given a number \( x \), reverse its binary form and return the answer in decimal.

**Example 1:**

Input:
```
x = 1
```
Output:
```
2147483648 
```
Explanation:
Binary of 1 in 32 bits representation-
```
00000000000000000000000000000001
```
Reversing the binary form we get, 
```
10000000000000000000000000000000
```
whose decimal value is 2147483648.

### My Approach

To reverse the bits of a number, we can iterate through each bit of the number from right to left (least significant bit to most significant bit) and build the reversed number bit by bit.

1. **Initialization:**
- Initialize a variable `ans` to store the reversed bits. Initially, set it to 0.

2. **Bit Reversal:**
- Iterate from `i = 0` to `31` (assuming a 32-bit integer).
- In each iteration:
  - Shift the `ans` left by 1 (multiply by 2) to make space for the next bit.
  - Take the least significant bit of `x` using the bitwise AND operation (`x & 1`), and OR it with `ans`.
  - Shift `x` right by 1 to process the next bit.

3. **Return:**
- Return the `ans` as the reversed binary form of `x` in decimal.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(log \(x\)), as the number of iterations depends on the number of bits in \(x\).
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long reversedBits(long long x) {
        long long ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
            ans = (ans << 1) | (x & 1); // Shift ans left by 1 and OR it with the least significant bit of x
            x >>= 1; // Shift x right by 1 to process the next bit
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
